<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Lemonades or Lemon ups whatever you want to call them are both lemon Girl Scout cookies that have stayed on the top of my list for years. To me, there is nothing more nostalgic than biting into a lemon-flavored Girl Scout cookie. As someone who consistently lived in OC the lemon Girl Scout cookie sold in my area has always been Lemonades by ABC bakers. I’ve been buying Lemonades (along with Thanks-a-Lots a discontinued GS cookie) since I was six years old. Lemonades have consistently been my favorite or second favorite Girl Scout cookie because I think it is perfect. It is the size of an actual cookie, the shortbread part is basically a crispy trefoil, and the icing on the bottom is so refreshing, light, and zesty. The combination is perfection, it tastes like the best lemon dessert shoved into a cookie. Most of all it also caters to my Chinese taste buds because it is not overly sweet like some of the other cookies such as Samoas, Smores, and Adevnturefuls. Not too sweet is the key to a satisfying dessert because that means the true flavor is not overpowered by the sweetness. When February rolls around each year and I see the cute little green Girl Scout cookie booth in front of the store I go buy Lemonades. What shocked me though is that Lemonades get so much hate. There was this video of a guy saying he would punch a Girl Scout if the only cookie she was selling was Lemonades/Lemon-Ups. &lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Why do these cookies get so much hate? Maybe because it is our human nature to conform with the majority? Everyone loves Thin Mints, and it is very obvious through just looking at Girl Scout cookie yearly sale rates. Out of the 800 million cookies sold each year, 25% are thin mints. Thin Mints are so popular to the point where Native made the cookie into a deodorant, shampoo, and body wash scent.Lemonades though do not get the same love, people barely buy them in the first place with only a little over 2% being sold each year making it beat only the least popular cookie Smores by 1%.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe the problem is people are not buying lemonade. Barely anyone recognizes them in the first place because people do not talk about them. When they are talked about people likely assume they taste bad because they are the second least popular cookie. If a cookie has little sales it must mean it tastes bad right? Even the Girl Scouts brand itself has been discontinuing all types of lemon cookies for years likely due to their lack of sales. Savannah Smiles a powdered sugar lemon cookie and Lemon Chalets a sandwich cookie are examples of discontinued lemon Girl Scout cookies. Why all the hate for lemon products? For me, I LOVE lemons. The best fruit with water is lemons, the best fruit to go on meats is lemon/lime, and lemon desserts are simply superior because their citrussy flavor makes the dessert feel less heavy. Maybe I am just too much of a lemon enthusiast, most people do not eat plain raw lemon slices like I do I get that. However, still I do not think lemonades deserve that much hate, most people who tried them liked them a lot.&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dl-HNkxUYAAdSzw.jpg":largealt="icecream" width="300" height="300" border-radius="100%" style="border-radius: 0px"&gt;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;The hate Lemonades receives shows me the power of conformity. People mimic other's interests for acceptance, society is constantly pressuring people to follow the status quo which in this case is liking thin mints and hating lemonades. Don’t get me wrong I love Thin Mints too but Lemonades are just so much more, they’re bigger, have the cutest lemon slice design, are just as crispy, and provide the same refreshing/cooling effect as a Thin Mint. In my opinion, I think Lemonades are just as good as Thin Mints, people just hate them because they are taught to hate them. As a picky little child, I loved Lemonades because I was unaware people hated them. I eat entire sleeves in my own home how would I know what other people thought of them? My point is we are heavily influenced by society when it comes to many things in this case it is Girl Scout cookie preference. Most people have hated on mint flavored things claiming it tasted like toothpaste but switch up when it comes to Thin Mints because more people like than dislike Thin Mints while more people dislike than like things like mint-flavored ice cream. Though both foods are mint flavored people love Thin Mints because it is the number one Girl Scout cookie which is unlike mint ice cream which does not make the top 5 ice cream flavors for consumers and gets compared to drinking orange juice after brushing your teeth. I may be just a crazy Girl Scout cookie enthusiast but my point here is that people should be more open-minded and be aware of the power of conformity. Oh also most importantly this online blog is supposed to encourage YOU to go buy a pack of Lemonades right now! As of writing this, it is February so go support your local Girl Scouts and buy a pack of cookies preferably Lemonades ;)!!&lt;/p&gt;</span></p>
